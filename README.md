## Project Description

The EpiAirConsole is a simulated professional work aims to teach us best practices in business.
For example:
 - submit a weekly report
 - write a complete documentation
 - ...

In this project there are three main parts to develop:
 - a main web page, to display main informations about the platform, all games available and QR code to connect controllers (smart phones) to the session.
 - an interface for controllers to have the right button depending on what game people are playing.
 - a server that stores all informations and communicate with main screen and controllers.

For this project I have chosen the following technologies:
 - server: Node.js
 - main web page / controllers: html/css/javascript
 - games: Phaser.js (/ C#/Unity)
